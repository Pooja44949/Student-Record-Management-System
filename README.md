# Student Record Management System (Java)

This project is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently using File Handling and the Java Collections Framework. It focuses on reading, storing, sorting, and managing student information in a structured and persistent way.

## Project Overview
The system loads student records from a file when the application starts and saves all updated records back to the file before exiting. It uses Java collections to manage data in memory and provides different operations for easy record management.

## Key Concepts Used
- File Handling using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
- Data storage using ArrayList and HashMap
- Sorting records using Comparator
- Traversing records using Iterator
- File attribute handling using the File class
- Random file access using RandomAccessFile

## Main Features
- Add new student records
- View existing student records
- Search student details by name
- Delete student records by name
- Sort student records based on marks
- Persistent storage through text files

## Learning Purpose
This project helps in understanding how to:
- Work with files in Java
- Use Java Collection Framework effectively
- Implement sorting and searching techniques
- Build structured and modular Java applications

## Usage
This project can be used as a learning tool to understand basic file handling, object management, and collection-based operations in Java.
